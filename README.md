# Pre-work - *Don't Forget To*

**Don't Forget To** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Elizabeth Tenorio**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [x] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [x] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The tuturial was a fun introduction to Android framework and I especially appreciate the clear explanation of concepts of adapters and interacting with files. I spent a bit of time to understand how to use Intent for launching other activities and passing data between activities. Sending back the edited text and displaying it in the correct location in the list view took some research and trial and error but it was very satisfying to see the app come together in the end. As next steps, I would be interested in implementing support for persisting data and completion dates once I get more fluent in Android development.
